    <header><h2>COVID-19: Sask. city hospitals at capacity, 3 more deaths</h2>
        <h4>Premier Scott Moe said Monday the province is considering possibly moving patients to rural hospitals to alleviate pressure on the cities.</h4></header>
    
    <p>He said about 70 per cent of beds are being used in rural Saskatchewan. Overall provincially, about 85 per cent of beds are being used, he said.

        “We would ask for some patience with families that have a patient, if we would have to move them potentially to a neighbouring community, so we are able to utilize the full provincial capacity that we have,” Moe said during a news conference.
        
        Saskatchewan reported three new deaths on Monday and admitted 10 more people to hospital.
        
        Since the pandemic began, 975 people in Saskatchewan have died due to complications with COVID-19.
        
        Of the 262 people in hospital, 233 are inpatient care and 29 are in ICU. Of these patients, 99 were not fully vaccinated.
        
        In the province’s two major cities, there are 124 hospitalized in Saskatoon and 56 hospitalized in Regina.
        
        Even though the government may use rural facilities, Health Minister Paul Merriman acknowledged staffing levels outside cities are stretched.</p>
